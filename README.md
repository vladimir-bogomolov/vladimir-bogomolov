I am continuously learning junior web developer with a Ph.D. in technical science. Currently in a process of switching my hobby into my job. I am working for the [Frood App](https://froodapp.com/) and learning web-development with [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/).

#### Personal projects
[**Frood App**](https://froodapp.com/)
Personalized label scanning app to detect hidden food allergens for people with a gluten or lactose intolerance. The app is in proggress, but you can try out the beta WhatsApp prototype. It can find hidden gluten and lactose if you send a photo of ingredients list. [Try out, it's free!](https://froodapp.com/en/download/)
