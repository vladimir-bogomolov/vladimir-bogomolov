I am continuously learning web developer with a Ph.D. in technical science. I am currently working for [Emakina NL](https://jobs.emakina.nl/) using Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) and corporate gitLab. So, I am not so often here these days ðŸ˜ž
<!-- I have side project the [Frood App](https://froodapp.com/). Take a look!  -->
I have no idea why you are here, but If you are thinking to learn web-development and based in Amsterdam, then [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) - is the best programming school for you.
